title: "Tsetse Fly"
vector: "Tsetse flies are bloodsucking flies of the genus Glossina. Sleeping sickness, as it is commonly called, is generally fatal in humans if left untreated."
spread: "HAT is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Trypanosoma, which is transmitted between infected humans and animals by tsetse flies (Glossina spp.) and enters the blood stream during blood feeding. Two species of Trypanosoma cause HAT, Trypanosoma brucei
rhodesiense and T. b. gambiense.
"
burden: "Sleeping sickness occurs in scattered foci throughout Africa south of the Sahara. In 1996, it was estimated that between 20000 and 25000 people die from the disease annually; however, the risk of severe epidemics continues to exist."
risk: ""
geogra: "They occur only in tropical Africa and are important as vectors of African trypanosomiasis in both humans and animals."
biology: "Tsetse flies are robust, 6–15mm in length, and can be distinguished from other biting flies by their forward-pointing mouthparts (proboscis) and characteristic wing venation (Fig. 2.1). There are about 30 known species and subspecies of tsetse flies belonging to the genus Glossina. They can be divided into three distinct groups or subgenera: Austenia (G. fusca group), Nemorhina (G. palpalis group) and Glossina (G. morsitans group). Only nine species and subspecies, belonging to either the G. palpalis or the G. morsitans group, are known to transmit sleeping sickness "
cycle: "The female tsetse fly does not lay eggs but produces larvae, one at a time. The larva develops in the uterus over a period of 10 days and is then deposited fully grown on moist soil or sand in shaded places, usually under bushes, fallen logs, large stones and buttress roots. It buries itself immediately and turns into a pupa. The fly emerges 22–60 days later, depending on the temperature. Females mate only once in their life and, with optimum availability of food and breeding habitats, can produce a larva every 10 days."
habitat: "The flies pass most of their time at rest in shaded places in forested areas. The preferred sites are the lower woody parts of vegetation; many tsetse flies hide in holes in the trunks of trees and between roots (Fig. 2.2). They search for food only for very short periods during the day. The flies often rest near to food sources. Common risk areas where people are likely to be bitten by tsetse flies are: on forest trails; near water collection points in forests; in vegetation close to bathing and water collection sites along the banks of rivers;"
food: "All tsetse flies, males as well as females, feed on blood, but the species differ in their preferences for the source of blood. Most tsetse flies feed preferentially on animals and only accidentally on humans. The most dangerous species are those that are flexible in their choice and feed on any blood source that is easily available, including humans. While searching for food they are attracted by large moving objects, by strikingly blue objects (1), and by carbon dioxide."
control: "A variety of methods can be used to control tsetse flies. Before suitable insecticides became available, control efforts mainly involved the removal of the woody vegetation forming the fly’s habitat. In areas of rhodesiense sleeping sickness, the primary food sources of the flies, wild game animals, were killed or removed. The tsetse flies then eventually disappeared because of food shortage. These methods have largely been abandoned and today insecticide spraying is used along with traps and insecticide-impregnated targets.
Traps and screens are an effective means of tsetse control. They are cheap, easy to transport, and completely safe for the user and the environment. Once a suitable trap or screen has been developed for a given area, no special expertise is needed in order to use it. This method is therefore ideally suited for anyone seeking to provide cheap and effective community protection.
The main objective of vector control is to reduce contact between people and flies. The most promising and environmentally acceptable vector control methods currently available are those in which tsetse fly traps and insecticide-treated screens are used. Under epidemic conditions, when very quick action is needed, insecticides may be sprayed on to resting sites of tsetse flies in vegetation.
