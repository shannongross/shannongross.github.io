title: "Aedes aegypti"
vector: "Aedes aegypti"
spread: "Aedes transmit filariasis, dengue, chikungunya,  zika, yellow fever and other arboviruses. It is today one of the most widespread mosquito species globally"
burden: ""
risk: "communities with lots of trash, waste bins or other water containers. Poor urban areas.  It thrives in densely populated areas which lack reliable water supplies, waste management and sanitatio"
geogra: "IN recent history, Aedes have been restricted to tropical areas due to its intolerance for temperate winters. However, over the past 2-3 decades, warmer temperatures around the world have increased its geographical distribution. "
biology: "Aedes need clean water containers to breed in"
cycle: ""
habitat: "Historically, Ae. aegypti was found in forested areas, using tree holes as habitats [12]. As an adaptation to urban domestic habitats, it is nowadays exploiting a wide range of artificial containers such as vases, water tanks and tyres [10]. It is also found utilising underground aquatic habitats, such as septic tanks [30], and adapting to use both indoor and outdoor aquatic container habitats in the same area. Adaptation to breeding outdoors may allow for increased population numbers and difficulty in implementation of control method

Aedes aegypti thrive in urban areas by laying in water-filled containers such as open cans, tires, garbage, etc filled with rainwater. Aedes adults like to rest indoors (under beds, behind curtains, inside closets) where they are protected from wind and rain."
food: "
Aedes aegypti prefer mammalian hosts [27] and will preferentially feed on humans, even in the presence of alternative hosts [28]. They also feed multiple times during one gonotrophic cycle (feeding, egg-producing cycle) [10,12,29] which has implications for disease transmission.
preference for feeding and resting indoors
This coupled with the close proximity of humans and the tendency of Ae. aegypti to feed on multiple hosts during one gonotrophic cycle [12] [10] [29], increases the risk of disease transmission in such areas.
"
control: "the distribution of this species is largely driven by human activities (e.g. storage of water outside) so control methods need to be directed at these factors. The primary prevention method is to eliminate breeding sites (containers laying around that can contain small amounts of open water). By getting rid of these breeding sites, less larvae will be able to become mature adults.

However, using a combined control strategy of spraying insecticides, reducing potential breeding sites and increasing public health awareness in Madeira following the discovery of Ae. aegypti, did not prevent this species from re-establishing "

*Aedes aegypti* is a daytime feeder: The peak biting periods are early in the morning and in the evening before dusk.

The *Aedes aegypti* mosquito is different than the *Anopheles* species that transmits malaria.

# Morphology & Control

Aedes aegypti | Anopheles
--- | ---
Bite during the day (both indoor and outdoor) | Bite late at night, mainly indoors (sleeping under mosquito net important!)
--- | ---
important in urban areas, especially near human homes (commonly found indoors) |
--- | ---
"Container breeders"- larvae found in containers on or near household premises |
--- | ---
Aedes eggs like fresh and **clean** water |
--- | ---
PPE: wear full clothing, use mosquito repellant, use treated curtains, LLINs may protect small children during daytime naps | PPE: LLINs treated with Pyrethroids
