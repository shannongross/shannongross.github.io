title: Shigella
prevalence: "Bacillary Dysentery (Shigellosis). Each year, Shigella species cause approximately 165 million cases of diarrhea, of which 700,000 are fatal. Over 60 percent of these fatalities are children under 5 years old."
geography: "99% of Shigellosis cases occur in developing countries, particularly in areas where war, natural disasters, or unhygienic living conditions lead to overcrowding and poor sanitation."
mortality: "There are several Shigella species and sub-species, some of which have reported case-fatality rates up to 20%."
morbidity:	"Significant dehydration and electrolyte loss with circulatory collapse and death occur mainly in debilitated adults and children < 2 yr."
affected: "Populations at highest risk of shigellosis are small children, especially malnourished children who are more likely to develop Shigella bacteremia. Infants, non-breast-fed children, children recovering from measles, malnourished children, and adults older than 50 years have a more severe illness and a greater risk of death."
pathogen: "There are several species and corresponding serotypes of Shigellae, however, it is S. flexneri and S. dysenteriae that are responsible for endemic and epidemic shigellosis (respectively) in developing countries due to their high rates of transmission and case fatalities."
vector: "None â€“ humans are the only reservoir."
transmission:	"Shigellosis is transmitted through the fecal-oral route, person-to-person contact, household flies, infected water, and inanimate objects."
symptoms: "In adults, shigellosis manifests as watery diarrhea indistinguishable from other bacterial, viral, and protozoan infections. In young children, onset is sudden, with fever, anorexia, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Weight loss and dehydration become severe. Untreated children may die in the first 12 days. If children survive, acute symptoms subside by the second week."
prognosis: "With antibiotics, clinical improvement occurs within 48 hours. Without treatment, prognosis may be severe."
immunity: "An episode of shigellosis imparts serotype-specific immunity for at least several years. But patients may have additional episodes of shigellosis caused by other serotypes."
