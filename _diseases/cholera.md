pathogen: "Vibrio cholerae is the causative agent responsible for cholera. It is a bean-shaped bacterium with a long tail that it uses for self-propulsion. Not all Vibrio cholera organisms are harmful. Non toxic strains of the bacteria also occur naturally."
vector: "Before infecting a human host, a key component of the vibrio survival strategy in its aquatic environment is the close interaction between the bacteria and a type of shrimp-like crustacean called a copepod. The cholera bacteria acquire strength in numbers through the formation of biofilms on the copepod surface. These biofilms act as a protective barracks for the bacteria—within the biofilm structure, the bacteria can survive unfavorable conditions during inter-epidemic periods.

The aggregation of the vibrios on the copepod also produces a very effective vehicle for transmission to human hosts. Studies suggest that anywhere from 103 to 105 vibrios are required to produce clinical cholera. However, as a result of biofilm formation, a mere 1-10 copepods can harbor enough V. cholera to lead to disease. In areas with poor sanitation and a lack of water infrastructure, copepods are commonly found in drinking water – dramatically increasing the risk of cholera infection."
transmission: "Cholera is acquired through ingestion of an infective dose of contaminated food or water and can be transmitted through many mechanisms. Water usually is contaminated by feces of infected individuals and can itself contaminate, directly or through the contamination of food. Contamination of drinking water occurs usually at source, during transportation or during storage at home. Food may also be contaminated by soiled hands during preparation or while eating.

A person can get cholera by drinking water or eating food contaminated with the cholera bacterium. In an epidemic, the source of the contamination is usually the feces of an infected person that contaminates water and/or food. The disease can spread rapidly in areas with inadequate treatment of sewage and drinking water. The disease is not likely to spread directly from one person to another; therefore, casual contact with an infected person is not a risk for becoming ill."
symptoms: "Symptoms and signs can range from asymptomatic carriage to severe diarrhea, vomiting, and profound shock. Symptoms include excessive, watery diarrhea; vomiting; dehydration; and, without proper treatment, rapid deterioration and death."
prognosis: "Without treatment, death can occur within hours. Untreated cholera is fatal in ≈25% of cases, but with aggressive volume and electrolyte replacement, the number of persons who die of cholera is limited to <1%."
immunity: "Asymptomatic cases might also contribute to the spread of the organism, albeit at much lower levels than symptomatic patients, and may reflect an important component of the acquired immunity that is seen in some communities."
