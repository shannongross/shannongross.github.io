title: "Lymphatic Filariasis"
prevalence: "Over one billion people are at risk of acquiring Lymphatic Filariasis (LF). Over 120 million are estimated to be affected by it, of which over 40 million are seriously incapacitated and disfigured. Recent estimates indicate that more than 50 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are affected, accounting for 37% of the global burden (Michael & Bundy 1997)."
geography: "LF is prevalent in more than 80 countries. One-third of the people infected with the disease live in India, one third in Africa and most of the remainder in South Asia, the Pacific and the Americas."
mortality: ""
morbidity: "The disease is a major cause of morbidity. It has been recognized as the second largest cause of long-term disability after mental illness (WHO 1999)"
affected: "LF is typically acquired in childhood but does not manifest visibly until adulthood, when it leads to varying levels of disability. "
pathogen: "LF is caused by infection with a mosquito-borne, parasitic worm. While feeding on a human host, infected mosquitoes transmit the parasites under the skin where they migrate to lymph nodes. Over about a year, the parasites mature into adult worms that severely damage the lymphatic vessels. Adult filariae live for several years inside their human host, producing missions of larvae which circulate in the blood and can be picked up and transmitted by new mosquitoes."
vector: "Mosquito-borne (mainly Culex, but also some species of Anopheles and Aedes)"
transmission: ""
symptoms: "Filariae lead to failures with the lymphatic system, including swelling, genital disease, and acute attacks. Most people infected are asymptomatic, but nearly all of them have subclinical lymphatic damage."
prognosis: ""
immunity: ""

Due to the devastating levels of morbidity caused by LF, the disease has a major social and economic impact on endemic countries.
