title: Ascaris lumbricoides
prevalence: "Global estimates indicated that over 1.2 billion people are currently harboring an Ascaris lumbricoides infection (CDC, 2019). "
geography: "Evidence suggests a spatial and climatic element of the distribution of ascariasis, with the parasite affected by both temperature and rainfall (Kabatereine et al., 2005)"
mortality: "Mortality rates are low, occurring only in extreme circumstances (heavy worm burden or complications)."
morbidity: "While Ascaris lumbricoides only leads to death in the rarest and most extreme circumstances, the levels of morbidity caused by chronic infections are likely substantial. These silent effects contribute to rates of malnutrition, anemia, mental and physical growth retardation, and are most harmful to young children and pregnant women who already face nutritional deficiencies (Tchuem Tchuenté, 2011)."
affected: "Infants, children, and pregnant women are the most affected by ascariasis."
pathogen: "The female Ascaris worm can measure up to 40 cm in length and 6 mm in diameter. The female will produce over 200,000 infective eggs per day which are excreted by the host. These eggs can survive in the environment for up to 10 years in favorable conditions. They are resistant to normal methods of chemical water treatment."
vector: ""
transmission: "Adult Ascaris parasites live in the intestines and passes infective eggs through the host’s feces. Hosts that practice open defecation spread Ascaris eggs in the environment, where they can be ingested by a new person. This occurs when dirty hands are put in the mouth or by consuming foods that have not been carefully washed (CDC, 2019). In endemic nations, individuals are exposed to infection from birth and are repeatedly at risk of re-infection due to inadequate WASH conditions and constant exposure to parasite eggs in the environment."
prognosis: "Treatment with albendazole has been shown to be effective, safe, and affordable. To provide doses of albendazole, the financial cost is estimated to be just 0.04 USD per child  (Kabatereine et al., 2005). The burden of Ascaris lumbricoides is subtle yet remains highly significant despite the availability of single-dose oral treatments (Kabatereine et al., 2005). "
immunity: "The protective effects of albendazole wear off after about one year, after which individuals may re-acquire the parasite."

Ascaris lumbricoides is the most prevalent type of soil-transmitted helminth (STHs). STHs are a widespread cause of debilitating diseases in infants, PreSACs, SACs, and pregnant women (Adriko et al., 2018). Infections with STH lead to increased rates of malnutrition, a decline an physical and cognitive development, and complications in childbirth (Adriko et al., 2018). The decline in work capacity is speculated to have a large impact on the economic development of low-income countries because of the loss in cognitive function experienced in childhood (Adriko et al., 2018).

One reason that Ascaris lumbricoides infection is generally overlooked on the world stage (it is classified as a Neglected Tropical Disease) is because infection is generally asymptomatic and will clear on its own when the parasite dies after 1-2 years. However, children with very heavy worm burdens may experience intestinal blockages and other complications. It is possible for worms to migrate from the intestines to other parts of the body, which generally causes the host to develop a cough and potentially other more serious symptoms (CDC, 2019).

The intensity of STH infection has been shown to aggregate in individuals: most people will have light to moderate infections, while a few people will be heavily infected and consequently become the major source of infection for others (Tchuem Tchuenté, 2011). When symptoms appear, it is generally because the host has been infected with a large number of worms at once, or else because the worm has migrated outside of the intestines. School-aged and Preschool-aged children have consistently been found to harbor the greatest number of worms, which leads to growth stunting, organ damage, impaired memory, and reduced educational performance (Tchuem Tchuenté, 2011). The highest ascariasis generally occur in those aged between 5 and 15 years old in endemic areas. After 15 years of age, prevalence declines and stabilizes, with most infections in adults being largely asymptomatic (Adriko et al., 2018).
