title: Cryptosporidium
prevalence: "Cryptosporidium pathogens are known to be a significant cause of diarrhea in people of all ages around the world. The two most globally important species of cryptosporidium are the subtypes <em>C. hominis</em> and <em>C. parvum</em>. Estimates suggest that 75% of cases are due to <em>C. hominis</em>, with the rest due to <em>C. parvum</em> (Mor & Tzipori, 2008)."
geography: ""
mortality: "Cryptosporidium infection is known to increase levels of child malnutrition, impair growth, and is a significant predictor of early childhood death in parts of Africa."
morbidity: "In children, cryptosporidiosis is associated with malnutrition, long-term growth retardation and cognitive defects  (Squire & Ryan, 2017). Studies have shown that a single episode of cryptosporidiosis in infancy can lead to stunting, even if the infection is asymptomatic (Squire & Ryan, 2017). "
affected: "In low-income countries, current estimates are that around 45% of children experience cryptosporidiosis before they are two years old (Mor & Tzipori, 2008). Young children also react most severely to the infection, experiencing watery diarrhea for at least two weeks."
pathogen: ""
vector: ""
transmission: "As a major fecal-oral pathogen, <em>C. hominis</em> is acquired through person-to-person contact and through contaminated food and water (Squire & Ryan, 2017). "
prognosis: "Cryptosporidium infection in children in low-income countries generally lasts for longer than 14 days, making it one of the leading causes of persistent diarrhea (Squire & Ryan, 2017). "
immunity: ""

A number of factors make cryptosporidium a particularly interesting pathogen. First, the parasite oocysts shed in high concentration in the feces of an infected individual, and feces are infective immediately upon excretion. A person can continue to excrete infectious waste for up to two months after they have stopped showing symptoms (Shirley, Moonah, & Kotloff, 2012). Second, the oocysts are extremely hardy since they can survive in the environment for at least 6 months under good conditions and are able to resist disinfection with chlorine even in high doses. Third, it only takes a few oocysts to sicken healthy individuals. After repeatedly acquiring the infection, an individual may gradually build up a tolerance to the pathogen, meaning that children and those with weak immune systems are most in danger (Shirley et al., 2012).

There is a substantial and synergistic link between cryptosporidiosis and malnourishment, with studies documenting much higher cryptosporidium prevalence among children with nutritional deficiencies (Mor & Tzipori, 2008). Additionally, the infection is significantly linked to HIV status. Despite cryptosporidiosis being ranked as one of the most serious causes of diarrhea in low-income countries, there is no effective therapy for patients that are HIV-positive or malnourished (Squire & Ryan, 2017).



Rural and urban dwellers might be expected to have different transmission patterns due to factors like zoonotic exposure, improved water and sanitation access, and population density; however, the limited evidence suggests that no rural-urban differences exist (Squire & Ryan, 2017). Knowledge of the true burden of cryptosporidium burden is incomplete, partially due to the lack of easy diagnostic mechanisms and study designs that produce widely varying estimates (Shirley et al., 2012).
