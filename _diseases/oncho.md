title: Onchocerciasis
prevalence: "Globally, at least 18 million individuals have onchocerciasis, 99% of whom reside in Africa. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 750,000 people are blind or have reduced vision as a result of the disease."
geography: "Currently, onchocerciasis is endemic to 31 African countries, to Yemen, and in localized foci in Brazil and Venezuela.  Globally, at least 18 million individuals have onchocerciasis, 99% of whom reside in Africa. The disease occurs in 35 countries. Of these, 28 are in tropical Africa, which is where 96% of the people at risk of onchocerciasis and 99% of those already infected live."
mortality: ""
morbidity: "Onchocerciasis is the second-leading infectious cause of blindness in the world. Affected persons often have a low body mass. Although not directly fatal, blindness and skin disease caused by onchocerciasis affect the hosts ability to assimilate into their societies, perform daily tasks, and care for themselves. Blindness alone has been estimated to reduce life expectancy by 4-10 years.

Prior to concerted control efforts, about 50% of men over the age of 40 years in some West African communities had been blinded by the disease. People therefore fled the fertile river valleys to settle in less productive upland country. In the 1970s, the resulting annual economic losses were estimated at US$ 30 million. According to recent estimates, 120 million people are at risk and 18 million are already infected. The disease is responsible for the loss of 1 million DALYs per year (WHO 2002b)."

pathogen: "Onchocerciasis is an eye and skin disease caused by the worm Onchocerca volvulus. It is transmitted to humans through the bite of blackflies (Simulium spp.), which breed in fast-flowing streams and rivers in the inter-tropical zones. Living near these breeding sites increases the risk of blindness, hence the commonly known name river blindness.

Onchocerciasis is caused by worms, Onchocerca volvulus. The adult worms measure nearly a meter long and live in coiled mating pairs in nodules under the skin. Reproducing adult females spawn about 2,000 immature worms every day. These tiny juvenile worms migrate throughout the skin and eyes, causing the various symptoms of the disease. Although they are damaging, these immature worms cannot mature to adulthood without being transmitted by a blackfly of the genus Simulium. This fly breeds in rapidly flowing streams and rivers, and thus the name river blindness."
vector: "Blackflies serve as the intermediate host of the parasite. Flies ingest immature worms when they bite infected people. As the worms live in the fly, they mature sexually over the course of a week. Then, should the fly bite a person, the maturing worm will grow to adulthood inside the human body. Upon finding mating partners, the adults become encapsulated and produce more immature worms, completing the full transmission cycle.
Repeated exposures to infected flies increase the number of adult worms and microfilariae in the host."
symptoms: "Inside the human body, the adult female worm (macrofilaria) produces thousands of larvae (microfilariae) that migrate in the skin and the eye. The death of microfilariae is very toxic to the skin and the eye, producing terrible itching and various eye manifestations (lesions). After repeated years of exposure, these lesions may lead to irreversible blindness and disfigurative skin diseases sometimes named leopard skin and lizard skin. symptomatic onchocerciasis usually requires heavy infestations and repeated exposure to the vector fly. Short-term travelers are at little or no risk of the disease. Symptoms of onchocerciasis reflect the developmental stage of the parasite and the degree of immune response by the host. Clinical manifestations are highly variable."
transmission: ""
prognosis: "Some eye manifestations and dermatitis resolve in patients undergoing ivermectin treatment every 6-12 months for the lifetime of the adult worm (approximately 12 years). Blindness, skin atrophy, and depigmentation do not improve with treatment. The life expectancy in blind persons is decreased secondary to difficulty coping with activities of daily living, by an estimated 4 years."
