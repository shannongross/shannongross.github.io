title: Escherichia coli (ETEC)
prevalence: "There are six major causes of diarrhea-causing <em>Escherichia coli</em>, with Enterotoxigenic <em>Escherichia coli</em> (ETEC) being the most common. ETEC is believed to be the cause of over 840 million episodes of gastroenteritis a year plus an additional 50 million asymptomatic cases in children (Gupta et al., 2008)."
geography: "There is some evidence to link ETEC prevalence with seasonality, with spikes seen during the warm seasons (Gupta et al., 2008)."
mortality: "Mortality rates from ETEC are challenging to estimate. Just like with cholera, if patients have a severe infection and make it to a medical center, then mortality should be <1%. However, if they do not come to a hospital, then the mortality rate may be much higher, perhaps up to 50% of severe cases (Qadri et al., 2005). "
morbidity: ""
affected: "Studies in recent years have indicated the frequency of ETEC in causing infantile diarrhea. In Egypt, it was found to account for 70% of diarrhea episodes in infants; in Bangladesh it was found to account for 18% of all diarrhea episodes for children under two years old (Qadri, Svennerholm, Faruque, & Sack, 2005). However, between the ages of 5 and 15 years old there is a decrease in episodes of ETEC. After age 15, the incidence rises again with about 25% of all ETEC cases occurring in adult patients (Qadri et al., 2005). In fact, in adults the cases are so severe as to be mistaken for cholera (Gupta et al., 2008). This is also true for the elderly, who may require hospitalization since they generally present with more severe dehydration than children (Qadri et al., 2005)."
pathogen: ""
vector: ""
transmission: "ETEC infection is primarily spread through food or water contaminated by human feces. In particular, the bacterium thrives in surface waters so transmission can occur through contact with this reservoir. "
prognosis: "Like any other diarrheal illnesses, the treatment for ETEC is to administer oral rehydration solutions.  Malnourished patients who acquire ETEC frequently experience more severe infections, potentially due to compromised immune status (Gupta et al., 2008)."
immunity: ""
references:  ""
symptoms: "After ingesting the pathogen, a person will typically show symptoms within 1-3 days and the infection will generally last from 3-5 days. Symptoms are profuse, watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping and vomiting, with potentially life-threatening dehydration (Gupta et al., 2008). "

One reason that ETEC is often underappreciated is because it is difficult to cultivate, while pathogens for cholera and rotavirus are much easier to detect (Qadri et al., 2005). Since ETEC is difficult to detect in the field, it is likely that mortality due to the pathogen would just be counted under “diarrhea” in many settings. The WHO has estimated that 380,000 children under 5 die from ETEC annually, although no comprehensive studies exist (Gupta et al., 2008).

Commonly, patients infected with ETEC are also co-infected with other fecal-oral pathogens which makes both clinical diagnosis and academic research more difficult. Estimates suggest that mixed infections occur in around 40% of ETEC cases (Qadri et al., 2005).

Direct person-to-person transmission is rare because ETEC has a high infectious dose (approximately 100-1000 organisms must be ingested), although children and persons with weak immune systems may be susceptible at lower doses (Gupta et al., 2008). Studies have shown that possessing improved latrine facilities significantly decreased ETEC infections in children (Qadri et al., 2005).
