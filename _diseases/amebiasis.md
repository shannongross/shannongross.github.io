title: "Amebic Dysentery"
prevalence: "Estimates suggest that over 50 million cases of amebiasis occur annually, resulting in as many as 100,000 deaths. The actual number of infections is likely much higher, since 80%-90% of people infected do not show symptoms."
geography: "The highest prevalence of Amebic Dysentery (Amebiasis) is in developing countries where barriers between human feces and food and water supplies are inadequate. Prevalence reaches as high as 50% in some low- and middle-income countries."
Mortality: "It is the second deadliest protozoan infection, after malaria."
Morbidity: "Amebiasis may lead to significant levels of morbidity."
affected: "The amebic infection is most severe in young children and the elderly."
pathogen: "Amebiasis is an infection caused by the protozoan parasite <em>E. histolytica</em>."
vector: "The parasite can be spread by vectors such as flies, rats, and cockroaches."
transmission: "The infective stage of <em>E. histolytica</em> can remain viable in environmental reservoir from weeks to months. The parasite spreads in the environment through soil and water contaminated by feces."
symptoms: "Most infections with <em>E. histolytica</em> are asymptomatic, with less than 20% of infections leading to noticeable symptoms. It is unclear why such a small fraction of infections become symptomatic, but likely are the result from interactions between the host, the parasite, and the environment.

The most common system of <em>E. histolytica</em> is diarrhea. A major difference between amebiasis and bacterial dysentery is that it can lead to the gradual onset of amebic colitis (inflammation of the colon) over several weeks."
prognosis: "If provided appropriate treatment, patients suffering from amebiasis generally have a good prognosis. However, they are susceptible re-acquiring the infection after therapy. Risk factors of amebic dysentery include: poverty, overcrowding, poor hygiene, lack of education, and contaminated water supply.  
Poor nutrition, through its reductive effect on the immune system, has also been found to be a risk factor."
immunity: "Individuals who have been infected with <em>E. histolytica</em> do not seem to gain any long-term immunity and are as susceptible to a new infection as other members of the population are"
