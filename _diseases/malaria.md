title: "Malaria"
prevalence: "Approximately 300-500 million cases of malaria occur each year."
geography: "Tropical climates, particularly Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia."
mortality: "Malaria causes an estimated 1-3 million deaths annually, of which the overwhelming majority are children under 5 years living in rural sub-Saharan Africa."
morbidity: "It is a leading cause of morbidity in refugee settings."
affected: "Malaria is of particular concern to small children and pregnant women, especially mothers who are pregnant for the first time. Not only are new mothers more likely to acquire malaria, they are also more likely to suffer negative consequences from the disease as well as pregnancy complications. Children aged under 3 years living in endemic areas are at increased risk of malarial death."
pathogen: "Plasmodia are protozoa. Only the species <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em>, <em>P. vivax</em>, <em>P. malariae</em>, and <em>P. ovale</em> are usually infectious for humans. Of these, the p. falciparum species is the most dangerous,  causing about 50% of cases and 95% of the deaths attributable to the disease."
vector: "Malaria is carried via the Anopheles mosquito, which primarily bites around sunrise or sunset. See <strong>Anopheles</strong> for life cycle information."
transmission: "Transmission occurs via mosquito bite. First-time pregnant women are especially susceptible and are 10 times more likely to contract malaria than nonpregnant women."
symptoms: ""
prognosis: "Infection with <em>P. falciparum</em> has a high mortality rate if untreated. However, malaria prognosis is excellent with early diagnosis and treatment."
immunity: "Some individuals with immunity can spontaneously clear the infection, but mechanisms underlying immunity remain poorly understood. Additionally, immunity may be lost over time."
