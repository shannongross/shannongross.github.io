title: "Buruli Ulcer"
prevalence: "Buruli ulcer remains a highly under-researched Neglected Tropical Disease, with prevalence estimates few and far between."
geography: "Buruli ulcer is found extensively in West Africa. The infection is mainly found in humid, tropical climates across Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Pacific. "
mortality: ""
morbidity: "WASH is helpful for morbidity control. Seems to be some link between Buruli Ulcer and drinking water, but this remains unclear."
affected: "Those infected are mostly women and children from rural areas near wetlands."
pathogen: "Buruli ulcer is caused by <em>Mycobacterium ulcerans</em>. Mycoveria are the same family of bacteria that cause tuberculosis and leprosy. The name <em>Buruli ulcer</em> comes from the region of Uganda that saw an outbreak of this disease in the 1960s."
vector: "Unknown."
transmission: "The exact means of transmission remains unknown, though recent research has suggested transmission through biting water bugs. Another theory is that it is acquired by penetrating skin injuries during outdoor activities."
symptoms: "Initially, the disease manifests as a painless swelling in the skin (usually in the limbs). A lump forms under the surface of the skin which is full of mycobacteria. <em>M. ulcerans</em>, unlike other mycobacteria, produces a destructive toxin that eats away at tissue and suppresses the immune system. Gross deformities are often the result of large ares of skin and bone being destroyed. Lesions often lead to scarring (causing restricted movement of limbs) and other permanent disabilities."
prognosis: "One important feature of Buruli ulcer is the minimally painful nature of the disease, which may partly explain why those affected do not seek immediate treatment (Werf et al. 2005)."
immunity: ""

Buruli ulcer is one of the most Neglected Tropical Diseases - very little information is available on its transmission or prevalence. After tuberculosis and leprosy, it is the most common infection caused by mycobacteria.
