title: Accomplishments & Qualifications

<h3>Professional Profile</h3>
<p>I recently attained my master's of science degree at the Delft University of
  Technology through the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/programmes/masters">Engineering and Policy Analysis</a> program,
  where I focused on using data science, modeling, and simulation, to address large-scale societal challenges.
  Prior to obtaining my master's degree, I had several years of engineering experience so I am comfortable
  working in client-facing environments, communicating technical results to a wide audience,
  and providing detailed deliverables. My skills cover a wide range of data science and
  programming tasks, including database management, big data, geospatial applications,
  and advanced modeling and simulation techniques. I am currently seeking a career as a strategy consultant or data scientist for a forward-thinking organization where I can use my technical
  background to help clients solve complex challenges.</p>
  <!-- <p>My academic research interests relate to developing <b>long-term strategies</b> to reduce the rate of <a href="/wash-diseases">preventable disease </a>and other
  public health challenges. I have been a <b>lifelong advocate</b> for increasing the adoption of improved water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services and behaviors in
  low-income countries.  -->

<ul>
    <li>Graduated Cum laude and attained a 9.0/10.0 score for my thesis on Evaluating <a href="https://github.com/shannongross/multi_disease_model/tree/master/report/Evaluating multi-disease interventions report.pdf">Multi-Disease Interventions</a>.</li>
    <li>Awarded the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/praktische-zaken/scholarships/justus-louise-van-effen-excellence-scholarships/">Justus van Effen Scholarship</a> for Excellence (2017 â€“ 2019).</li>
		<li>Extensive work on the subject of innovation in disaster response through the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/tbm/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/multi-actor-systems/research/humtech-lab/humtech-lab/">HumTechLab.</a></li>
		<li>Advocate for more strategic design of community health programmes which emphasize the
      importance of integrating external factors like infrastructure
      and behavior when tackling communicable diseases.

      <!-- Many of my academic projects
      focused on developing policies to prevent waterborne disease transmission, particularly
      for endemic countries where malaria, dysentery, and parasitic worms are a
      part of daily life. -->
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>2010-2014 - Gannon University - BSc Environmental Engineering </h3>
<ul>
    <li>Graduated Cum laude with a capstone project of a water filter to remove arsenic from groundwater in Bangladesh</li>
  	<li>I recieved the Peter C. Braeger Undergraduate Writing Award for my <a href="https://shannongross.github.io/blog/2014/08/14/isil">essay on water scarcity.</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://gannonknight.com/?p=5235">Founded an exchange program</a> with the American University of Madaba in Jordan.</li>
		<li>I was an ArcGIS Lab Teaching Assistant, supporting a Geographic Information Systems course of 25 students.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>EXPERIENCE</h2>
<h3>2017-2019 - TU Delft - Humanitarian Technology Lab Assistant</h3>
  <ul>
   <li>I presented my research on the role of airports in disaster response to a joint task force of humanitarians and aviation officials at the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) headquarters in Montreal, Canada. <a href="https://www.unitingaviation.com/strategic-objective/safety/the-role-of-aviation-in-humanitarian-assistance/">See the article published by Uniting Aviation.</a></li>
   <li>My work at HumTechLab over the past two years has been primarily aimed at bridging the gap between student researchers and humanitarian practitioners. In February 2019, I led a select <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/2019/tbm/humtechlab-at-hnpw-2019/">delegation of students</a> to present research at the Humanitarian Networking Partnerships Week in Geneva, Switzerland.</li>
   <li>I played a leading role in the direction and organization of the HumTechLab's activities. Below is a clip of an interdisciplinary research meetup that I helped to coordinate, which was aimed at connecting humanitarian-related researchers from different departments to one other.

<h3>2015-2017 - Stantec, Inc. - Environmental Engineer, F.E.</h3>
<ul>
   <li>At Stantec, I was charged with assuring regulatory compliance for over 40 industrial clients across the southeastern USA. I performed regular site visits to these facilities in order to assist with their environmental permits and regulatory contingency plans.</li>
   <li>My previous co-op experience along with my work at Stantec has given me over four years of experience auditing manufacturing facilities for compliance with local and federal environmental, health and safety regulations.</li>
   <li>I worked extensively on soil and groundwater remediation projects, which required me to: classify soil borings; collect groundwater samples; prepare potentiometric contours;  and mobilize drillers, surveyors, and other subcontractors.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2011-2014 - General Electric - Environment, Health and Safety</h3>
<ul>
   <li>During my time as an EHS co-op, I was responsible for environmental sample collection across the 340-acre facility. I collected and reviewed results for over 1,000 PCB samples and identified $350,000 in annual savings opportunities to management.</li>
   <li>I created a comprehensive Incident Learning Process in order to reduce variability in accident investigations. I personally delivered 90-minute intensive training sessions to over 100 operations management personnel.</li>
	 <li>I assisted in launching a Waste Reduction program with the goal of reducing total plant waste by 25% over 2 years. I directed the program advertising campaign to escalate employee awareness and involvement in the program.</li>
