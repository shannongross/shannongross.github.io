<h1>Shannon M. Gross</h1>
<h3>MSc Engineering and Policy Analysis</h3>
<p>I recently attained my master's of science degree of the Delft University of
  Technology through the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/programmes/masters">Engineering and Policy Analysis</a>,
  where I focused on using data science, modeling and simulation to address large-scale societal challenges.
  I have several years of prior engineering experience and am comfortable
  working in client-facing environments, communicating technical results to a wide audience,
  and providing detailed deliverables. My skills cover a wide range of data science and
  programming tasks, including database management, big data, geospatial applications,
  and advanced modeling and simulation techniques. My academic research interests relate to
  developing long-term strategies to reduce the rate of preventable disease and other
  public health challenges. I have been a lifelong advocate for increasing the adoption
  of improved water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services and behaviors in
  low-income countries. I am currently seeking a career as a strategy consultant or
  data scientist for a forward-thinking organization where I can use my technical
  background to help clients solve complex challenges.</p>
