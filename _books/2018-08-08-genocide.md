<!-- A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide by Samantha Power (American ambassador to the United Nations)

> A quote from the book

--- Great author -->


Power's work is important because of her insider's view of how policymakers in the United States have been reluctant to use the term "genocide", even when faced with the most blatant atrocities. It forces us to confront the true meaning of the word and the weight it carries. If we use it too often, does it then begin to lose its meaning? If we don't use it often enough, are we being cowardly or turning a blind eye? And most of all - if we do say that a genocide is happening, are we obligated to stop it (at any cost)?

While its easy to take the moral high ground and say of course Americans should stop genocide, whenever it occurs - the reality may lead to a slippery slope of Americans becoming the ultimate arbiters about what is right and wrong in the world. Power uses her time as the ambassador to the United Nations, along with thorough historical accounting, to provide various perspectives of conflicts such as Kosovo, Rwanda, Iraq, and Cambodia, to provide a nuanced perspective of a profoundly important issue.
