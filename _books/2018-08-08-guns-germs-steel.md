> A history focused on western Eurasian societies completely bypasses the obvious big question. Why were those societies the ones that became disproportionally powerful and innovative? The usual answers to that question invoke proximate forces, such as the rise of capitalism, mercantilism, scientific inquiry, technology, and nasty germs that killed peoples of other continents when they came into contact with western Eurasians. But why did all these ingredients of conquest arise in western Eurasian and arise elsewhere only to a lesser degree or not at all?

My initial impression of this book was one of astonishment. I had never read a book where an author attempted to cover such a **massive scope** in such **extraordinary detail**. In just the first few chapters, Diamond seems to cover all of human history from hunter-gatherer-times until today. His experience working in Polynesia gave him first-hand insights which he uses to enrich his theories in fascinating detail.

But this book isn't exactly a "cozy-up-with" and "unwind-from-a-long-day-of-work" kind of book. When I've described it to friends, I use the word "dense". If this book was an element, it would sink to the bottom of a body of water faster than a lump of Platinum. The mere **scope** of how much the author covers means that you won't breeze through it on a Sunday afternoon - unless you're already an expert in agriculture, geology, and anthropology - not to mention an exceptionally fast reader.

While anthropologic critics about Diamond's work are plentiful, I believe that this text provides an important perspective to counter dangerous Western-centric worldviews. For anyone who considers him or herself a global thinker, it's important to challenge yourself with Diamond's theories on why the world is the way that it is today. Whether you agree or disagree with his more provoking claims (such as the reason for Western superiority is that it "got lucky"), you'll want to read his work and be able to defend your position either way.
