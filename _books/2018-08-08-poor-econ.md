For anyone interested in a career in <a href="/moral-obligation/">global development</a>, this book is a must-read. Based on years of site visits and research conducted at MIT's Poverty Action Lab, Banerjee and Duflo provide an essential perspective of poor communities around the world.

For me, the most striking parts of this book were the examples that seemed highly opposed to anything I head read about global development before.The authors do not propose some grand, large-scale development project to solve the issues they describe. Nor do the authors conclude that development projects ought to be discarded completely to let free markets run their course. Instead, the examples in this book seem to shift back and forth between the two schools of thought, highlighting why neither on its own was a sufficient.

*Poor Economics* does not provide an answer to the dilemma of global poverty, but its radically fresh perspective is a much needed update to the stagnant, outdated ways that "the West" views less-wealthy nations.
