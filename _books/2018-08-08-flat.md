This is an essential book for the global thinker because of its in-depth analysis concerning the topic of globalization. According to Friedman, technology has helped to create a level playing field for economies around the world. To thrive in this new world, employers should strive to keep their companies flexible and adaptable to change.

A central theme of this book is the movement of outsourcing jobs from the U.S. economy to foreign countries. Friedman is right to analyze this trend - whether it ultimately be for the good or the ill of the American economy, a global thinker should consider how these economic shifts are likely impact the future.  


> When the world is flat, you can innovate without having to emigrate. This is going to get interesting. We are about to see creative destruction on steroids. How did the world get flattened, and how did it happen so fast?
--- Thomas Friedman
