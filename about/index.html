title: About Shannon Gross
---
<p>I strive to be the type of person who supports others in achieving their biggest goals.
  As a lifelong student and future-focused thinker, my mission is to continuously acquire
  technical skills and use them to improve the world around me.
  I believe that many of the biggest challenges we face in business, government, and
  society are technically solvable but require greater collaboration, motivation, and reasoned thinking
  if we are to sufficiently address them during our lifetime. My personal academic research has long focused on the
  issue of water-related illnesses, which are some of the biggest drivers of mortality and morbidity
  around the world even though they are esily preventable with modern knowledge and technology. Many pressing issues
  seem to share this theme: the problem has an apparently straightforward solution and yet we cannot seem to achieve it.
  I enjoy facilitating this discussion, helping friends and clients to realize key roadblocks, potential opportunties,
  and scenarios they perhaps had never considered before. If you are interested in working on
  a project together, feel free to contact me or take
  a look at my <a href="/cv">online resume</a> for a list of my professional qualifications.</p>
