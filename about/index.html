title: About Me
---
<h1>Hi, I'm Shannon </h1>
<p>I use data science and computer modeling tools to support strategic
  decision-making surrounding water, sanitation, and public health. If you're
  interested in working on a project together, feel free to contact me or take
  a look at my <a href="/cv">online resume</a> for a list of my professional qualifications.</p>


<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I am devoted to preventing <a href="/wash-diseases">waterborne diseases</a>, particularly for endemic countries where malaria, dysentery, and parasitic worms are a part of daily life. </li>
  <li>In my academic research, I advocate for more strategic design of community health programmes which emphasize the importance of integrating external factors like infrastructure, climate, and behavior when tackling communicable diseases.</li>
  <li>My work at HumTechLab over the past two years has been primarily aimed at bridging the gap between student researchers and humanitarian practitioners. </li>
</ul>
