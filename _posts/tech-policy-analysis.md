Innovative new tech opportunities such as machine learning are already disrupting a wide variety of global issues. To be a part of the cool shift towards AI though, you'll have to master a lot of old-school things like classical statistics and randomization, which is why I've included several tutorials in this blog. But you'll find no examples of coin flips and dice-rolling here, because you can find that in plenty of other textbooks and websites. Instead, my focus is on the messy and uncertain situations that surround real-world policymakers. While the people who craft our environmental regulations, disaster budgets, and health insurance policies certainly rely on mathematical and statistical information, there is (hopefully) more to their decision making than measuring and coin-flipping.

The process of policymaking is probably never linear, although you'll find a number of decision analysis texts that seem to portray it as if it were. More likely, policies are made through interactions between multiple stakeholders (or "actors") and over a series of compromises, tangents, and revisions. Also, many policy ideas "sit on a shelf" until the right window of opportunity presents itself - perhaps through a shift in public opinion or financial opportunity - that makes the idea suddenly become favorable. Any multi-actor problem is bound to grapple with diverging interests, culture differences, miscommunication and differing information sources. And of course, the jaded among us will hark of corruption, partisanship, and hidden agendas. However, this is the nature of the world we live in and which really big and important decisions are made.

Those of us who are technically-inclined serve an important role in supporting those who are appointed to create large-scale policies. Whether you are:
- an engineer advising on the safety of a new infrastructure project;
- a data scientist making projections from census data;
- an epidemiologist giving input on how government money should be spent against a novel disease;
- an IT expert weighing in on a program to combat a cybersecurity threat;

All of these technocrats play a role in the ability of policymakers to make evidence-informed decisions. However, it is misleading to think of your role merely as the "neutral advisor".

Policy analysis is messy and often subjective.

# A Primer on Model-Based Decision-Making
- you can easily make a policy, but it wont be adopted easily if it conflicts with exiting norms/institutions
- Recap from Hans: Don’t blame politicians if the results from science aren’t used
- What strategies make a modeler valuable broker for a politician?
- Better models, communication, interaction, broker
- Note “better” model may be different for a scientist and a politician. What are the quality criteria?
- Where in the policy process can you use which strategies?
 - Claim of this course: exploratory modelling offers the modeler a set of techniques that can be used for these strategies
 - We can still assist the decision-maker, not by telling them the right answer, but telling them what is completely impossible, etc.
- How does deep uncertainty relate to wicked problems? There’s no one single way to frame the problem. You need a combination of scenarios, perspectives.
- Traditional approach: try to predict the future and design plans to optimize this future. But what if you’re predictions suck or people disagree on the models?
- New approach: explore and adapt. Identify differences that make a difference. Design plans that are insensitive to these differences
- Our decisions are “political” too, i.e. when we choose thresholds for PRIM analysis. No correct answer.
- To get insight from big data you need computational skills that politicians lack. They often rely on analysts from the private sector
- To analyze big data, there are usually more ‘political’ decisions to be made than in ‘normal’ data
- Most policy questions are not terribly specific. Specifying them requires understanding of available data. This gives ‘power’ to analysts
- Make sure the story you’re focusing on is the right story. Information demand be sure that you align your work to the actual questions policymakers want empirical answers to, not that you’re analysing something else.
- Get the story right. Data is assumed to be objective because we have institutionalized its use, however, we must understand that no analysis is truly ‘objective’ and all data collection and modelling captures just part of the picture.
- Expert opinion has traditionally played an ambiguous role in basic constitutional arrangements, and it is not clear what their level of “responsibility” is. There are striking differences between responsibility assigned to decision makers and responsibility assigned to experts.  (Turner, 2005)
- Expert knowledge is impersonal knowledge expressed or formulated by individuals, while political responsibility is personal and judged by collective processes. (Turner, 2005)

Sarewitz, D. (2004) How science makes environmental controversies worse. Environmental Science & Policy 7, 385-403. doi: 10.1016/j.envsci.2004.06.001
- Gore-Bush election: The dispute was not resolved by addressing the technical aspects of the vote count
- Climate change: Each level of analysis is not only associated with its own competing bodies of contestable knowledge and facts, but is also dependent on how one views the other levels of analysis.
- When cause-and-effect relations are not simple or well-established, all uses of facts are selective
- Reduction of uncertainty is a central, perhaps the central, goal of scientific research carried out in the context of environmental controversies
- The standard model, of course, is that if uncertainty surrounding the relevant scientific facts can be reduced, then the correct course of action will become more apparent. Uncertainty is thus portrayed as the cause of inaction. But the notion of a clearly demarcated body of relevant fact is highly problematic.
- Uncertainty in environmental controversies is a manifestation of scientific disunity (excess of objectivity; disciplinary diversity) and political conflict
- Recognizing that simple, linear formulations leading from “more science” to “less uncertainty” to “political action” are inherently flawed, others have suggested that society needs to adopt new ways of thinking about the conduct of science
