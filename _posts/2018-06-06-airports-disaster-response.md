# Assessing Airport Infrastructure for Disaster Response
In the aftermath of a natural disaster – such as an earthquake, hurricane, or flood event – affected communities may find themselves unable to cope and in need of outside assistance. In order to reach affected communities during the critical response period (72 hours after the disaster) Humanitarian aid organizations rely on well-functioning airports to deliver search and rescue teams, medical personnel, food, water, shelter, and other life-saving supplies to the area. However, unprepared airports may quickly become overwhelmed by the sudden surge in demand on their facilities by the large number of responders who wish to enter the damaged area as well as civilians who wish to get out. Along with a dramatic surge in demand, the airport may also be suffering from damaged runways, loss of power, staff shortages, and other effects of the disaster. When this happens, the airport becomes a logistical bottleneck that prevents life-saving aid from reaching the intended recipients during the critical response period.

Preparing airports to cope with the effects of a natural disaster can greatly improve the performance of humanitarian response operations. The methodology used here focuses on using existing, publicly available databases to facilitate decisions regarding prioritization of airport preparedness resources. Due to the large number of airports globally and the relatively little research that has been on this topic from a global, humanitarian perspective, data availability was a crucial limiting constraint. By reviewing and consolidating existing information, this study hoped to pave the way for a global humanitarian airport preparedness database to be created in the near future.
