## Population Growth in Uganda
This is a simple example of modeling population growth in Uganda using system dynamics techniques. System dynamics modeling is beneficial for studying feedback loops, time delays, and other nonlinearities. To create the model, the population is divided into a small number of compartments (e.g. by age). Here, the population is divided into\:
* Infants
* PreSACs (preschool-aged children)
* SACs (school-aged children)
* Adults
* Elderly

If you are beginner in continuous modeling and/or Vensim, this example may be helpful for your own studies.
