In recent months, a Sunni Muslim insurgent group has surprised the world with a wave of complex military victories as it attempts to establish an “Islamic State” across Iraq and Syria. It was unexpected to outsiders who viewed the Islamic State as yet another anarchic and obsolete terrorist group. However, the rebels have shown astounding levels of sophistication and strategy as they swiftly capture targets along the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. What distinguishes the rebels of the Islamic State is their keen awareness of how water resources shape the lives of all Syrians and Iraqis – past and present. If policymakers wish to understand or outmaneuver these insurgents, they have to be just as aware of the real power that water resources hold in the Middle East. This paper discusses how water scarcity contributed to the instability in Iraq as well as the civil war in Syria, and how the Islamic State has since used water to exploit the chaos.
