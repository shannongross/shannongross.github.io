# What is Policy Analysis?
Policy analysis is about using analytical tools and structured approaches to support policymaking processes.

A **policy problem** occurs when:
-	there is a **gap** between an existing or expected situation and a criterion (a principle or norm)
-	there is a **dilemma**: there is an expectation that something can be done about the gap, but it is not readily apparent how to best proceed.

Policy analysis is closely related to decision analysis. The traditional steps of decision analysis are:
1. Structure the decision problem. (Who are the stakeholders? What are their options?)
2. Determine the possible consequences of each alternative
3. Determine the preferences of the decision makers
4. Evaluate and compare the alternatives

However, policy analysis involves decisions on **many levels** (i.e. it is typically not just one, particular decision the analyst needs to be concerned with).

# The System Diagram
- **System**: a part of the reality that is being studied as a result of the existence of a problem or the suspicion thereof
- **System model**: clarifies the system by
  - Defining its boundaries
  - Defining its structure (the main elements and the relationships among them)
System model is actor-specific – it describes the situation from one actor’s viewpoint
- **Problem**: the perceived gap between the desired situation and the actual situation
  - The person who perceived the gap wants to know what can be done about it
- **Objectives**: description of the desired situation. Belong to a specific problem or project. Objectives are interests made concrete. An actor strives to achieve a situation-specific objective to ultimately realize his interests
- **Criteria**: used to measure objectives (quantitatively)
  - Ex: if objective is “better traffic safety,” criterion might be “number of accidents per year”
- **Means**: policy instruments used by the problem owner to influence the system to achieve their objectives. Anything that can be used in order to achieve an objective
- **External factors**: elements that cannot be influenced by the problem owner or by the factors inside the system, but that do place important limitations or constrains on the behavior/outcome of the system
- **Interests**: the total values and desires that an actor finds important regardless of the specific situation (Interests also called *fundamental objectives*)
  - Examples of organizational interests: equity, justice, biodiversity, animal welfare, economic growth, competitiveness, etc.
  - Examples of individual interests: good health, good income, etc.

# Intro to Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis
**Criteria**: condition with respect to a factor (= system attribute) that is (or should be) considered by an actor while making a decision. This condition is often expressed as a specific threshold value, but it can also be expressed as a rule or a combination of rules.	“Fortunately, my grade for this course satisfies the passing criteria.”

**Multi-Criteria Model**: used to support a decision maker in choosing one out of several alternatives (e.g. objectives tree)
A **score card** is essentially nothing more than a consequences table with colored cells. A well-chosen color scheme based on the criterion values greatly enhances the communicative function of a consequences table.

**Preference elicitation**: Actor preferences are preferably measured by means of pairwise comparison. When using this method to determine the relative weights of criteria, the analyst repeatedly presents her client two criteria, asking “Which one do you find more important?”. Doing this for all possible pairs of criteria results in complete information on her client’s preferences.
- Problems of pairwise comparison:  
  -	A drawback of this method is that it requires a lot of effort:  for N criteria, the client should compare 1/2N(N  1) pairs.
``-	the client may not be consistent in his preferences
