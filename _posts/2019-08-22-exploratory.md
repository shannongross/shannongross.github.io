Evidence-based public health policymaking is difficult. One reason for this difficulty is because the “evidence” presented to decision makers is often too specialized to address broad policy concerns. This is especially the case in low-income countries, where evidence to support health policymaking is often lacking or inappropriate (e.g. suggesting overly-technical solutions). Furthermore, low-income countries not only have less resources but a far higher burden of infectious disease than the rest of the world. Policymakers in such settings are pressured to use finite resources to control a large number of different public health issues.

Quantitative modelling is useful for simulating the effects of different disease interventions, particularly when testing them in real life would be impractical or unethical. The vast majority of quantitative models, however, are used by researchers to design a control strategy against a single pathogen of interest. Unfortunately, looking at one pathogen in isolation is much less useful from a policy standpoint than it is in a laboratory setting. Policymakers are rarely interested in a single pathogen under narrowly-defined conditions, being charged more broadly with the general health and welfare of their communities. In the real world, isolating one disease from another is difficult because any decision to invest in a particular intervention is also an implicit decision to not invest in a different strategy. In order to understand which intervention out of many is most worth investing in, policymakers would need to refer to a large number of different disease models. To meet policy concerns, there is a need for models that evaluate across a wider landscape of public health issues
