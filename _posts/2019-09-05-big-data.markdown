We live in an age of data. **Datafication** refers to the increasing number of activities conducted in a semi-digital environment, where sensors, devices, and apps collect data about these activities. As a result, there are more and different datasets one can use to (partially) answer the same question. Scientific questions that seem simple enough to quantify at face value become "politicized" based on the techniques or datasets used to calculate them. For instance:
* How much have global surface temperatures risen in recent years? ([Taking Politics Out of Climate Change](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/depoliticizing-climate-change/))
* What is the current unemployment rate? ([The Politics Surrounding Jobless Data](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/2330443X.2016.1241061))
* How old is the human race? ([Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District](https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/cases/kitzmiller-v-dover-area-school-district))

These questions seem to lie squarely in the domain of scientific study, yet because of their political or social ramifications they become highly contested. Each side argues that their opponent is using a flawed techniques, definitions, or datasets in order to generate results that are favorable to them. In such highly-charged environments, big data analysts must be careful and transparent in their modeling choices and assumptions.

# What do we mean by "Big Data"?
A common definition of **Big Data** is based on multiple "V's" that each denote a characteristic of big data: volume, variety, velocity, etc. However, this definition presents a operational problem because we canâ€™t have a meaningful threshold for any of these (i.e. what is a "big" volume?). Instead, it may be more useful to think of Big Data analysis as the:
> Combination of multiple, large datasets from various sources (unstructured and structured, internal and external) and the application of advanced analytic techniques to gain new insights beyond the applications that the data were originally collected for.

Large datasets can be extremely useful to inform and guide strategy development. Yet, policymaking occurred long before the advent of big data. So how have decisions been guided historically? Perhaps with little evidence behind them, a phenomenon which still occurs. There is a substantial body of research to support the idea that policy decisions are often not based on evidence, but instead made by "gut feeling" or by following precedent.

But big data can be tremendously useful for solving policy problems. A major problem, however, is that people are often unaware of the **assumptions** behind the data they use. Data is often assumed to be objective, however, we must understand that no analysis is truly "objective" and all data collection and modelling captures just part of the picture. Failing to fully understand the context of information can lead to **big data discrimination**, where models are trained on historical data which codifies patterns of discrimination.

# The role of big data analysts in policymaking
Analysts provide computational skills that can support politicians in gaining insight from big data. However, big data analysis frequently involves more "political" decisions to be made during the analysis compared to "normal" data. The way that assumptions are quantified and relationships are structured may already inject political subjectivity into the analysis.

As an analyst working on policy-relevant concerns, it is important to consider the shortcomings behind big data. Analysts must take care not to take data only at their face value, but to interrogate the assumptions and methods used to create them. This is especially the case for contentious political issues. If you (as the analyst) do not question the characteristics behind your assumptions, then your political opponent is sure to!

## Convincing policymakers of big data evidence
In the world of big data, it is getting easier to make the claim that there are different sets of facts (alternative facts). It is easier to criticize data, bring up competing data, and argue system boundaries. In order to provide policy support in this increasingly complex and data-driven world, the following are recommended:
- Construct the facts along with the stakeholders to make agreement more likely.
- Make work more attractive to policymakers by showing strategies that can help solve stalemates.
- Redefine and broaden problems. Create new options for decision makers.
- Present a variety of solutions or solutions that have wiggle room.
- Evolve from a solely "objective/scientific" external expert toward a policy facilitator role.
