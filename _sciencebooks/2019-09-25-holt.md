Beyond marveling the achievements of previous scientists and mathematicians, I found that Holt's ability to capture the biography of each person highly inspiring. Holt remarks on the sad coincidence that so many of these individuals met tragic ends - like insanity, ostracization, or suicide. Their flaws are what make them human, and it is important to remind oneself that the makers behind seemingly magical concepts like $$ E = mc^2 $$ faced rejection and failure in their lifetimes. I am inspired by the struggles faced by geniuses such as Alan Turing, who was shamed for his homosexuality and ultimately died quite tragically - his top-secret accomplishments to help defeat the Germans during WWII were never recognized in his lifetime - and yet in spite of his suffering, his work remains some of the most profound in history. Without his inventions leading to the modern computer, I may not have been able to type this to you now.

By humanizing these geniuses, Holt reminds us that we should never give up on our work to develop new ideas no matter how much we struggle or are rejected by others.
